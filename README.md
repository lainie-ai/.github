LAINIE.ai is building its own proprietary methods for developing contextually relevant and accurate models. The CEO Thomas Underhill started from a spark of an idea aimed at democratizing legal resources to the tangible challenges of bringing that vision to life. LAINIE.ai evolved from a concept to a revolutionary player in the legal tech space. By pioneering AI-driven legal solutions, LAINIE.ai is making legal services more accessible and efficient, transforming the landscape of legal technology and services.

We have made the difficult decision to wind down LAINIE as a company after failing to secure investment to continue. Our CEO is joining another company in September 2024. However, we will start a conversion of the business logic into an open-source project here.
